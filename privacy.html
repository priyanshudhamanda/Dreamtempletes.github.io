    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this privacy policy
        (“Policy”). This Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide
        (“Personal Information”) on the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
            href="https://priyanshudhamanda.github.io/Dreamtempletes.github.io">/Dreamtempletes.github.io/</a>
        website (“Website” or “Service”) and any of its related products and services (collectively, “Services”), and
        our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that Personal Information. It also
        describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and
        update it.</p>
    <p>This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and this Website operator
        (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a business or other
        legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case the
        terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not
        agree with the terms of this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not access and use the
        Website and Services. By accessing and using the Website and Services, you acknowledge that you have read,
        understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy. This Policy does not apply to the practices of
        companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.</p>
    <h2>Collection of personal information</h2>
    <p>You can access and use the Website and Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information by
        which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of
        the features offered on the Website, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your
        name and e-mail address).</p>
    <p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you fill any forms on the Website. When
        required, this information may include contact information (such as email address, phone number, etc).</p>
    <p>Some of the information we collect is directly from you via the Website and Services. However, we may also
        collect Personal Information about you from other sources such as public databases and our joint marketing
        partners.</p>
    <p>You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take advantage
        of some of the features on the Website. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome
        to contact us.</p>
    <h2>Privacy of children</h2>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age
        of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Website and Services. If you have reason to
        believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us through the Website and
        Services, please contact us to request that we delete that child’s Personal Information from our Services.</p>
    <p>We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce this
        Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through the Website and Services
        without their permission. We also ask that all parents and legal guardians overseeing the care of children take
        the necessary precautions to ensure that their children are instructed to never give out Personal Information
        when online without their permission.</p>
    <h2>Use and processing of collected information</h2>
    <p>We act as a data controller and a data processor when handling Personal Information, unless we have entered into
        a data processing agreement with you in which case you would be the data controller and we would be the data
        processor.</p>
    <p> Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving Personal Information. We act in the
        capacity of a data controller when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is necessary to ensure
        your access and use of the Website and Services. In such instances, we are a data controller because we
        determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Information.</p>
    <p>We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal Information through the Website
        and Services. We do not own, control, or make decisions about the submitted Personal Information, and such
        Personal Information is processed only in accordance with your instructions. In such instances, the User
        providing Personal Information acts as a data controller.</p>
    <p>In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we may need to collect
        and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able
        to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used
        for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Improve user experience</li>
        <li>Run and operate the Website and Services</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Website and Services, where you are
        located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more
        specific purposes; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you
        and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal
        obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public
        interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of
        the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.</p>
    <p> Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing
        by opting out, without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases. In any case, we will be happy
        to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of
        Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a
        contract.</p>
    <h2>Disclosure of information</h2>
    <p> Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any Service you have
        requested, we may share your information with our affiliates, contracted companies, and service providers
        (collectively, “Service Providers”) we rely upon to assist in the operation of the Website and Services
        available to you and whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with
        respect to Personal Information. We will not share any personally identifiable information with third parties
        and will not share any information with unaffiliated third parties.</p>
    <p>Service Providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as necessary to perform services
        on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. Service Providers are given the information they need only in
        order to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose any of the provided
        information for their own marketing or other purposes.</p>
    <h2>Retention of information</h2>
    <p>We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations,
        to enforce our agreements, resolve disputes, and unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by
        law.</p>
    <p>We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete
        it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal
        Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification,
        and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.</p>
    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>Our Website and Services use “cookies” to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that
        is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to
        your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that
        issued the cookie to you. <a target="_blank" href="cookies.html">Click here</a>
        to learn more about cookies and how they work.</p>
    <p>We may use cookies to collect, store, and track information for security and personalization, and for statistical
        purposes. Please note that you have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically
        accept cookies by default, but you can modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer.</p>
    <h2>Data analytics</h2>
    <p>Our Website and Services may use third-party analytics tools that use cookies, web beacons, or other similar
        information-gathering technologies to collect standard internet activity and usage information. The information
        gathered is used to compile statistical reports on User activity such as how often Users visit our Website and
        Services, what pages they visit and for how long, etc. We use the information obtained from these analytics
        tools to monitor the performance and improve our Website and Services.</p>
    <h2>Do Not Track signals</h2>
    <p>Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have
        your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with a
        website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from consumers
        who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time. How browsers
        communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, the Website and Services are not yet set up
        to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more
        detail throughout this Policy, we limit our use and collection of your Personal Information.</p>
    <h2>Links to other resources</h2>
    <p>The Website and Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware
        that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We encourage you
        to be aware when you leave the Website and Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every
        resource that may collect Personal Information.</p>
    <h2>Information security</h2>
    <p>We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from
        unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical
        safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal
        Information in our control and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can
        be guaranteed.</p>
    <p>Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are security and
        privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of
        any and all information and data exchanged between you and the Website and Services cannot be guaranteed; and
        (iii) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party, despite best
        efforts.</p>
    <h2>Data breach</h2>
    <p>In the event we become aware that the security of the Website and Services has been compromised or Users’
        Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including,
        but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures,
        including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law
        enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected
        individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the User as a result of the breach or if
        notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will send you an email.</p>

    <p>This acceptable use policy (“Policy”) sets forth the general guidelines and acceptable and prohibited uses of the

    </ul>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>No spam policy</h2>

        policy for use of the Website and Services in any manner associated with the transmission, distribution or
        delivery of any bulk e-mail, including unsolicited bulk or unsolicited commercial e-mail, or the sending,
        assisting, or commissioning the transmission of commercial e-mail that does not comply with the U.S. CAN-SPAM
        Act of 2003 (“SPAM”).</p>
    <p>Your products or services advertised via SPAM (i.e. Spamvertised) may not be used in conjunction with the Website
        and Services. This provision includes, but is not limited to, SPAM sent via fax, phone, postal mail, email,
        instant messaging, or newsgroups.</p>
    <h2>Enforcement</h2>

        immediately take corrective actions, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>

        to you in other ways at our discretion, such as through the contact information you have provided.</p>
    <p>An updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Policy unless
        otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Website and Services after the effective date of the revised
        Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes. However, we
        will not, without your consent, use your Personal Information in a manner materially different than what was
        stated at the time your Personal Information was collected.</p>
